<h3>About</h3>

App made using a tutorial by [@JoeKarlsson](https://github.com/JoeKarlsson).

Code is mostly as instructed, but I added some custom **CSS**.

<h3>Problems</h3>

Took a while to deploy the site with GitHub pages. The index.html file is within a subdirectory, but when I moved it to the root the program wouldn't build.

This [stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25320356/can-i-have-my-github-pages-index-html-in-a-subfolder-of-the-repository) suggested creating a dummy index.html file and it worked.
